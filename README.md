## Nolan McMahon

Hi! I'm a physicist, mathematician, and computer scientist from Calgary, Alberta, Canada! My interests center around simulation, mathematical optimization, and backend systems - mostly.

## Scripture Phaser

My primary side project is called Scripture Phaser. It's a tool to aid with Bible memorization. You can get it [here](https://pypi.org/project/scripture-phaser/).

## Open Source Contributions

When I run across issues in open source projects, I love to contribute fixes! Here is a list of the open source contributions that I've made so far:

- [OpenFSAM](https://github.com/nfherrin/OpenFSAM/pull/8) [Fortran]: I added support for functions with discrete parameters to the simulated annealer.
- [Scikit-Learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27668) [Python]: I fixed a type checking error with the degree parameter of the polynomial kernel.
