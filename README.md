# Nolan McMahon

Hi! I'm a physicist, mathematician, and computer scientist from Calgary, Alberta, Canada! My interests center around simulation, mathematical optimization, and backend systems - mostly.

# Projects

I've made a couple of free software projects myself!

- [Note](https://github.com/NolantheNerd/note) [BASH]: Manage your notes without ever leaving the command line!
- [Scripture_Phaser](https://github.com/NolantheNerd/scripture_phaser) [Python]: Helps you to memorize Bible passages!

These are complete enough to be useful. I'm sure that they still have bugs, but I'm confident enough to open them up to the public. 

I have many other projects on the go, but I'll wait until they are more polished to "release" them.

# Open Source Contributions

When I run across issues in open source projects, I love to contribute fixes! Here is a list of the open source contributions that I've made so far:

- [OpenFSAM](https://github.com/nfherrin/OpenFSAM/pull/8) [Fortran]: I added support for functions with discrete parameters to the simulated annealer.
- [Scikit-Learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27668) [Python]: I fixed a type checking error with the degree parameter of the polynomial kernel.
