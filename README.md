# Nolan McMahon

Hi! I'm a physicist, mathematician, and computer scientist from Calgary, Alberta, Canada! My interests center around simulation, mathematical optimization, and low level systems - mostly.

# Projects

I've made a couple of free software projects myself!

- [Note](https://github.com/NolantheNerd/note) [BASH]: Manage your notes without ever leaving the command line!
- [Scripture_Phaser](https://github.com/NolantheNerd/scripture_phaser) [Python]: Helps you to memorize Bible passages!

Those are more or less complete. I'm sure that they still have bugs, but I'm confident enough to open them up to the public. 

Right now, I'm actively working on:

- dm [Fortran]: A simulation of how diseases spread through a population.
- nolnet [Go]: A multi-protocol static site generator that I (want to eventually) use to manage my [website](https://www.nolanmcmahon.net).
- flint [C]: A free linter for the Fortran programming language.

I'll make the source code available for those projects when they are more polished, so stay tuned!

# Open Source Contributions

When I run across an issue in an open source project, I love to contribute fixes! Here is a list of the open source contributions that I've made so far:

- [OpenFSAM](https://github.com/nfherrin/OpenFSAM) [Fortran]: I added support for functions with discrete parameters to the simulated annealer.
- [Scikit-Learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) [Python]: I fixed a type checking error with the degree parameter of the polynomial kernel.
